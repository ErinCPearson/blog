# Topsheet Blog


### Submitting A Blog

Once you have completed a blog, in **Mardown Format** submit a blog, first click on the folder `posts` then click on button in the top right corner `Create new file`.  

At the top left of the body, there is a empty box that says `Name your file...` in that field type the title of your blog, but do it in a format with **No Spaces** , spaces should be replaced with `-` as well as there should be **NO capital letters**. At the end of the title, type `.md`, so your final project should look something like this `this-is-my-title.md` 

In the body paste your Markdown Formated blog, then click `Commit new file`.

When adding an image the the Markdown format should look somethign like this
